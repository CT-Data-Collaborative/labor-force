      "value": "Labor Force reports the number of civilian noninstitutionalized labor force participants, which includes employed and unemployed persons; and the unemployment rate (per 100 persons). The civilian noninstitutionalized labor force is all persons aged 16 and over who are not on active duty in the Armed Forces and who are not inmates of institutions, including prisons, mental facilities, and nursing homes who are either employed or unemployed. Employed persons are labor force participants who, during the week when data was collected, do any work as paid employees (at least one hour), work as self-employed, or are temporarily absent from work during the time of data collection period but otherwise employed. Unemployed persons are labor force participants who, during the week when data was collected, do not have jobs, who have actively looked for work in the past 4 weeks, and who are currently available to work. The unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. The Connecticut Department of Labor reports monthly and annual averages. CTdata.org carries the monthly data and the annual averages. In 2015, LAUS redesigned its methodology (see Technical Notes for more detail). This new methodology was carried back to 2010, hence, many areas can be expected to see breaks in the series between 2009 and 2010. Since data cannot be compared overtime, ctdata only carries cdata.org from 2010 onward.",
